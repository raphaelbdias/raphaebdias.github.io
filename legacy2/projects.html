                    <p class="project-description">
                        Developed an immersive, terminal-style puzzle game inspired by the Riddler’s cryptic hacking sequences. 
                        Users experience a simulated “boot and traceroute” intro that clears the screen before 
                        tackling a series of riddles with inline prompts, hints, and dynamic feedback. 
                        This project highlights advanced DOM manipulation, puzzle logic, and thematic styling, 
                        creating an engaging “hacker” vibe reminiscent of <em>The Batman</em>.
